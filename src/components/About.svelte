    <h1>Alexis Vega</h1>
    <p>
      Can you believe my passion for coding began with one of my favorite shows
      - Silicon Valley? 10/10 recommend! I was so fascinated that I thought I
      would dust off my Myspace HTML skills and give it a go! And, welp, here I
      am now!
    </p>

    <p>
      My journey into coding wasn’t like most. I started school as a Biology
      major with aspirations of becoming an anesthesiologist. I soon realized
      this wasn’t the path for me. Fast forward a couple years away from school
      and I found myself 1: in love with the idea of coding and 2: in love with
      the city of Chicago! In a short one month’s span I applied to IIT, got
      accepted, and moved across the country just in time for the 2019 Fall
      Semester.

      I had several opportunities while in school to expand my knowledge of
      software engineering. I discovered my interest in topics such as Data
      Mining, Web Development, and iOS. I had the opportunity to work with
      technologies such as NLP and GPT2 in order to experiment with classifying
      hate speech on the internet. I spent a full semester embracing iOS
      development using Xcode and Swift, only to be granted the opportunity to
      then tutor students on those same topics I learned, greatly improving my
      own knowledge in the process. I also spent time self-teaching web
      development, which proved to be endlessly useful during my summer
      internship at Grainger. Fun Fact: I built this website using the same
      technology I learned there! I am proud to say I ended my school career
      (for now!) with my BS and MCS with a specialization in Software
      Engineering.
    </p>

    <p>
      But I have a life, I swear! When I’m not at my computer, I really enjoy
      trying new things such as cooking new recipes, discovering local
      restaurants and bars, and attending neighborhood festivals. What can I
      say, I’m a foodie!
